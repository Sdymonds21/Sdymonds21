I am EXTREMELY excited and a TOTAL AMATEUR to this whole process. But, I am looking forward to being able to (eventually) gaining employment, maybe helping non-profits and others who cant afford to pay "retail" prices for a site and being able to say "I DID IT SUCKAH'S" to those who had little to no faith in me! ;)
